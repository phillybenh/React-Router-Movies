[Lecture Notes](https://www.notion.so/React-Router-v5-50884cc526374daba3620e75a01516a7)

* *Client-side Routing* - JavaScript manages the routing and controls the site URl and content without having to wait for a server to respond. This design mimics the appearance of a traditional multi-page website

* *Server-side Routing* - The traditional way the web has worked. Each link or address bar change is a request to a remote server

* *Single Page Applications*
    * 

* Set up routes
    * `Router`
    * `Route`
    * `Link Components`

* Using Router's hooks
    * use `useParam` hook to add dynamic Routes to an application
    * use `useRouteMatch` hook to add nested Routes to an application
    * use `useHistory` hook to programmatically navigate to other routes
